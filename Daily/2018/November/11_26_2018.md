# Debug Node.js with VSCode

VSCode enables us to debug Node.js directly from the editor.
We can add breakpoints by clicking on the left of a line. Or by pressing `F9` while being on the line.

Pressing `F5` will try to launch a debug session. But for more complex use cases, it's better to configure the launch properties inside `.vscode/launch.json`.
